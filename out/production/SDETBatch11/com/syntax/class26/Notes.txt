Wrapper classes:
Wrapper classes are object classes around primitive datatype that have built-in methods and are used as objects where necessary.
for example in collection framework.

Wrapper classes provides us a mechanism to use primitive data types as objects

Boxing :
The automatic conversion of primitive data types into its equivalent Wrapper called boxing.
for example if we type: Integer i = new Integer (10); this is called boxing

AutoBoxing:
the automatic conversion of primitive data types into its equivalent Wrapper is called autoboxing
for example: Integer i =10;

UnBoxing:
The conversion of equivalent Wrapper to primitive data types is called unboxing.

for example : Integer i =new Integer (10) this is called boxing
              int i2 = i.valueOf() this is called unBoxing


AutoUnboxing:
The conversion of equivalent Wrapper to primitive data types is called unboxing

Integer i = 10; autoboxing
int i2=i; auto unboxing

Collection frameWork:
Collection  framework  in  java  provides  an architecture to store and manipulate the group of objects that represented as a single unit.
We have many interfaces and classes inside the framework to achieve this.


ArrayList
<> Diamond operator issued to specify the data type in collections framework.
ArrayList<Double> numbers=new ArrayList<>();
