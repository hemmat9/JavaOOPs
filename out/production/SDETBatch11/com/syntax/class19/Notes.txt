Inheritance:
is a mechanism in which one class acquires all the properties and behaviors/methods of the super class
except private members and constructors.
we use extend keyword to inherit from a class.
benefits of inheritance:
1- Saves time to code
2- it takes less memory
3- execution time is less
4- code duplication is reduced
Disadvantages
1- In inheritance base class and child class both are tightly coupled, hence, if we change the code of parent class
it will affect all the child classes.

Types of Inheritance
there are 4 major types of inheritance which are supported in most of the OOP languages, but JAVA only supports 3 types with classes
1- Single Inheritance
2- Hierarchical Inheritance
3- MultiLevel Inheritance
4- Multiple Inheritance (this type is not supported by Java).

* Single Inheritance
if we have one base (Parent) class and one derived(Child, sub) class from it, it is called single Inheritance.

* Hierarchical Inheritance
if we have 1 base (Parent) class and multiple derived (children, sub) classes from it, it is called Hierarchical Inheritance.

* MultiLevel Inheritance
A class extends from another class which is already extended from another class
* Multiple Inheritance
Multiple base (Parents) classes but has one derived (Child) class

Diamond Problem ?? is related to the multiple Inheritance
in multiple inheritance there is multiple super-classes and single sub-class,
