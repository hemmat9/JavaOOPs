final is a keyword in Java that we can use with classes fields and methods, it is non access modifier.
1)if a class is final that class is not inherited, but it can inherit from another classes.
Private and final methods can be overloaded but not be overridden.
2) when used with methods that method can not be overridden in child classes.
3) when used with fields we can not change the value of those fields.
