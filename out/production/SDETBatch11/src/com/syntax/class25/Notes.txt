Abstract class:
They are classes with the keyword abstract.
it is used to hide the implementation but only showing the functionality to the user.
abstract is a class that you don't want to implement methods, or you are not sure how to implement a method, but you want to implement it through the child class.

Rules:
1-Must participate in inheritance, otherwise we will not be able to use any instance methods or fields.
2-Abstract class can have 0 or any number of abstract methods.
3-If you have abstract method in a class then the abstract keyword is a must tobe used with the class name.
4-We can have non-abstract methods as well inside the abstract class.
5-We can declare a class as abstract class even without any abstract methods.
6-Abstract keyword cannot be used with fields and constructors.
7-We need a child class to provide implementation of abstract methods.
8-When we extend an abstract class we must either provide the implementation of all unimplemented method in the child class,
or we must declare the child class as abstract class.
9-We can extend only one class in java abstract or non-abstract

Interfaces:
Interface is collection of public static final variables (Constants) and public abstract methods plus static, default and private methods. (from Java 8 and 9).
It is a contract that a class has to implement.
interface is similar to the abstract but interfaces are heavily used in java.

Rules:
1-Can have only public static final fields.
2-As there are no instance fields in interfaces, so they don't have constructors as well.
3-We can not create object of an interface because they can only have un-implemented methods.
4-A class can not extend an interface, but it is implemented by a class.
5-An interface can extend another interface.
6-An interface can extend many interfaces it means interface support multiple inheritance.

Encapsulation:
Encapsulation means that all data members(Variables, fields, methods) are together as a single unit inside the curly bracket.
Create your fields private and make getter setter methods to access those fields. (getter and setter methods are used to access the value of a private variable).
