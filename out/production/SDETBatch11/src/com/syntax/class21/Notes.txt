Overloading:
    When same name method is existing in class multiple times with different
    number of parameters or different sequence of parameters or different data
    types then it
    is called method overloading.
Benefits:
    Cleanliness of code
    flexible code
    Easy for end user
Rules:
    1) Access modifiers(public private etc.) do not play any role in method overloading.
    2)Non access modifiers(static final etc.) do not play any role in method overloading.
    3)Method return types also don't  play any role in method overloading we can't overload
    a method by just changing the return type.
    4) Method names must be same if we want to overload a method.
    5) parameters should be different for each method either in number or in sequence or in
    Data types.
    6) we can overload constructors private methods main method.
===============================================================================
Overriding:
    Overriding happens when same methods exists in parent and child class.
Benefits:
    we can have specific implementation for a method that is already defined in the parent class. That we have this
    flexibility that we don't have to come-up with different names if we are doing same thing again in the child class.

Rules:
    1-we can override a method but the restriction level should get reduced. like, from private to public
    2-static methods have the same rules, but we use a different terminology we say we are re-declaring a method instead of overriding.
    3-return types must be same in overriding
    4-Name must be same
    5-parameters should also be same.
    6-we can't override a private method
