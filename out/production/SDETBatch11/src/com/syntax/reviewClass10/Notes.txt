Final Keyword
    1- Final keyword is used to restrict the programmers.
    2- When we use it with variables we can't change their values once they are initialized.
    3- We can override those variables for example I can have same name variable in the child class without caring about the access/non-access modifiers.
    4- if we want to initialize the static field we can also use static initializer blocks.

Final with methods:
    if we used the final keyword with methods we cannot override that method in the child class.

Final with class name
    if we use the final keyword with class name we can't inherit that class. But that class can inherit from other classes.

=====================================

Abstraction:
    Abstraction in Java means hiding the implementation details and providing only the functionality to the user.
    we define the input/output of a method inside the parent class and make that class as abstract.


Interface:
if two entities don't have parent child relationship we can create an interface for those entities.

Encapsulation:
Encapsulation is using data(variables/fields) and code (methods) together as a single unit.
