Super Keyword
it is used to refer to the parent's class instance, we can use super keyword in 3 different ways
1)- to call the parent class constructor super()
2)- to call the method from parent class.
3)- to use the fields from the parent class.

class Parent{
String name="Mohammd Gul";
double salary;

void eat(){
sout "Kebab"
}
}

class Child extends Parent{
Child(double salary){
super(salary) //should be the first line
}
String name="Ahmet";
void eat (){
sout "more kebab"
}

printfood(){
super.eat()//refers to the parent class
eat()//refers to the child class
}


}
