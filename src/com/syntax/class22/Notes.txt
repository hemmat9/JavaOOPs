Rules for casting object/Classes
1- We can store a child class object inside a parent type variable because inheritance
is one way from parent to children.
2- we can create arrays of type parent and can store all the objects of child classes
inside that array then we can write loops to call all the child classes inside that array then
we can write loops to call all the methods from all the classes.
Note: polymorphism happens when there is overriding/ without overriding there is no usage of
polymorphism example of webDriver is perfect example.
3- we can not store/cast a parent class object to child class but if parent type variable
(Father son= new Son();) here (Father son) is parent type variable, but if parent type variable already contains
the child object then we can get it back by casting it.

Final Keyword:
if we write final with variable we can not change its value either we should initialize it right away or thorough the constructor.
When use with a method we cannot override that method in the child class.
when used with class that class is not inherited to the subClasses.
