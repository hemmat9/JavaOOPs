Why learn fileHandling in Java:
1)_ Putting sensitive info inside the code is not a good idea because everyone who has the access to the code will be able to see them
2)_ Every time we test our application on different environment we have to change the code to update the credentials it's also not an idea and can introduce bug.


We will be discussing two types of files
1- Properties File
2- Excel File

Properties File:
Data is stored in the form of Key values pairs
To read the data from any file we should know the path then we can use FileInputStream class to load that file inside java program.

FileInputStream
Loads the data inside the program in the form of bytes
Using properties.load() method data is converted to key value pairs, and we can use the methods from Map interface to read and write the data.
