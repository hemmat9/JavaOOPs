ArrayList:
ArrayList is a class in collections framework that help us to store, delete, retrieve and manage data easily as compared to Arrays.
It has many built in methods to manipulate the data.

Two types of Lists:
ArrayList /and LinkList
ArrayList:
ArrayList uses arrays internally to store and manipulate the data.
When to use ArrayList:
when we have to retrieve data mostly use ArrayLists.
LinkedList:
When we have to write the data in-between, or in-front of the list most of the time we should use LinkedList.

Properties of List:
1- They maintain the insertion order
2- They can contain duplicate data as well.
